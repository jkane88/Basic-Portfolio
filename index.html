                    <p>My name is Justin Kane. I am a father of two, husband and musician.I work full time at a company that fabricates fork truck forks and attachments. I do a lot of work forecasting orders with our current ERP as well as helping with programming around the production area. We have an oxy table, as well as CNC machine and a robotic weld arm that I am in charge of programming and trouble shooting. I am looking to find a job programming full time, all the time.</p>
